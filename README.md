# AccurateDpsMeter
DPS Gui Meter thats actually accurate.

Drop the AccurateDpsMeter.dll in your BepInEx Plugins folder
Drop the config file int the BepInEx/Config folder

If you have the BepInEx Config Manager also installed
you can press F1 in game and change the Mods settings
from color to intervals. I have also included my config
file to get you going right out of the box without the 
need to touch anything. Middle Mouse button allows you to
drag it across the screen to your desired position. 

(optional): I recommend dragging Erenshors original built in meter
off screen to the bottom right corner. I'll update the mod in the 
future to be able to toggle the original off and on completely.
